### `Description `
---
The program writes to the output a description of the tokens it recognizes in its input.
 It will use a lexical analyzer - the function (yylex) - written by flex. The yylex interface will return a number indicating the type of token it found. In case the token has a semantic value, it will write it to the global variable yylval which will be defined as union.

##### `input`
